programming 1

turn in:
    email the code with instructions on how to run it
    a write up too
        describe the three heirustics
        for each H
            solution path for each initial state
            avg number of steps over the 5 trials
        write 1 paragraph with conclusions from these results.

puzzle: 8-puzzle 

implement algorithms:
    best first
    A* search 

implement heuristics
    the 2 in the book
    1 of your choice

stop search:
    if not reach goal state
    after max number of steps

input: configuration of the 8 puzzle like:
    (4 5 b 6 1 8 7 3 2)
    b = where the blank one is

    goal sate:
    (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 b)

initial states
    run on 5 of them
    output the solution path found (if any)
    eg:
    (4 5 b 6 1 8 7 3 2) → (4 b 5 6 1 8 7 3 2) → ... → (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 b)

XC
    extra credit
    repeat for 15-puzzle (4x4)
    exclude the solution paths
    include number of steps per each heuristic.
